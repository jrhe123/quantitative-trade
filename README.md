### Take rice as an example,

#### Doing long: you are optimistic that the price of rice will rise, buy or borrow rice to stock up, and sell it to make a difference when the price of rice rises.

#### Short selling: you are optimistic that the price of rice will drop, borrow rice from the rice boss, then sell it for money, wait for the price of rice to drop, then use the money to buy rice and return it to the rice boss, the price difference.
